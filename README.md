Group Assignment 1 - ICS 372

In the root directory I have 3 folders: input, output and processed.
Input is where I drop JSON files
Output is where I output JSON files with all shipments from a warehouse
Processed is where I archive all JSON files.

Obviously, we can change those directories and rename them if needed.
