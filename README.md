Group Assignment 1 - ICS 372

In the root directory I have 3 folders: input, output and processed.
Input is where I drop JSON files
Output is where I output JSON files with all shipments from a warehouse
Processed is where I archive all JSON files.

Obviously, we can change those directories and rename them if needed.

	- Hey guys, are you sure you want to create a GUI? It might be too much work. My suggestion is to 
	make an interactive console app instead. It is up to you though. Btw, you can respond to it by modifying this README.md file.
	Once we are done with the project we will erase the history of our communications. Make sure you date your responses and 
	add your name.
